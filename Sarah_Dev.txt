Updated stickman script to use my controller for movement, including
wall jumping and wall sliding.
I implemented my own physics on the player, which includes affecting
there physics when wallsliding, so the important part of this update
was that PLAYER'S RIGIDBODY 2D IS NOW KINEMATIC.

We make it kinematic, rather than entirely delete it because
otherwise the player's triggers won't work. Here's some detail from
unity's website:

Static Rigidbody 2Ds are designed not to move, and collisions between two Static Rigidbody 2D objects
 that intersect are not registered. However, Static Rigidbody 2Ds and Kinematic Rigidbody 2Ds will interact with each other if one of their Collider 2Ds is set to be a trigger. 

Getting rid of player's rigidbody 2D entirely will break triggers,
so keep it as a kinematic rigidbody2D.
